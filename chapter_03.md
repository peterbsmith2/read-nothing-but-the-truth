### The Scharff Method 
When you have the skills of rapport-building--to make another person feel connected to you--you can even turn a hostile source into omeone who interacts with you in a productive way. This is what Hanns Scharff did; he is the German Luftwaffe interrogator whose psychological techniques of connecting positively with prisoners have shaped U.S. non-physical interrogation practices in modern times.  
  
Sharff was a self-taught interrogator who became fluent in English before the war while working in South Africa. Prisoners expected harsh, Gestapo-style treatment when they wre marched into the room at Dulag Luft POW Camp, where they would be interrogated by him. Insstead, they met a man who would soon draw out of them far more than name, rank, and serial number.  
  
Key features of the Scharff method, which partially depended on the fact that prisoners were held in solitary confinement upon their arrival at the camp, included Scharff's own preparation, reinforcement of the prisoners' sense of insecurity, and establishing a respectful and comforting connection that relieved their sense of isolation.  
- He tried to know everything possible about the prisoner before the interrogation began. He collected information about the pilot's military service, as well as his personal circumstances. He wove in such things as travel times from one place to another that would be familiar to the prisoner. Scharff's homework and insertion of relevant details into his conversation with prisoners helped him create the illusion that he knew a great deal about their military activities. It was psychologically disarming to prisoners who assumed he knew more than he did, so they were inclined to disclose infromation. It also laid a strong foundation for building rapport. Not only did Scharff speak English, but he also seemed to have a familiarity with their lives, values, and situations.  
- He made it clear to the prisoner that working with him and the Luftwaffe was far preferable to being labeled a spy, with his fate then being in the hands of the Gestapo. The message kept prisoners off balance a bit, reminding them they were vulnerable, and at the same time gave them a reason to draw closer to Scharff.  
- He dsiplayed freindship. He went for walks in the woods with the men, took them to the zoo, and gave them flights in a German fighter plane. Depending on the environment and how that engendered certain kinds of conversation, the prisoners leaked myriad types of information, from social habits of military personnel to aircraft capabilitiy.  
Scharff claimed that his rapport-building skills enabled him to obtain information from 90 percent of all prsioners. Mastering techniques such as those used by Scharff positions you perfectly to get the truth from someone.
